        <h1 class="header">About Mardi Gras - New-Orleans</h1>
        <img src="Images/aboutImage1.jpg" class="aboutImage1">
        <p>
            Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of
            the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove
            Tuesday. Mardi
            Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods
            before the
            ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.

            Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious
            obligations
            associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more
            usually
            known as Pancake Day or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer
            the
            sacrament of confession to; to absolve").

        <h1 class="header">The mayor of New-Orleans : LaToya Cantrell</h1>
        <img src="Images/TheNayor.jpg" class="aboutImage1">
        <p>
            LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
            mayor, Cantrell
            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012-2018.
            Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
            University of
            Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the Harvard
            Kennedy
            School. Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she
            joined the board of the
            Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the 2005 levee
            failures in
            Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained
            mostly
            deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel
            convened by
            then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
            neighborhoods to be
            converted into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents
            and local
            religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning
            Broadmoor
            residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.[7]

            Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
            residents formed
            the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school.[8] She
            served as a
            founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that
            provided case
            management and other social services for returning residents.[9] She was involved with residents' efforts to
            reopen
            Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment.[10] She
            created a
            partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided the
            neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.[11] She also formed a partnership
            between the
            Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
            Broadmoor Art and
            Wellness Center.</p>

        <img src="Images/aboutImage2.jpg" class="aboutImage1">
        <p>
            The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana,
            consider
            Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins
            Epiphany) to Ash
            Wednesday. Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras. In Mobile,
            Alabama,
            Mardi Grasâ€“associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving,
            then New
            Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash
            Wednesday. In
            earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day. Carnival is an important celebration in Anglican and
            Catholic
            European nations

        <h1 class="header">Costumes</h1>
        <img src="Images/aboutImage3.jpg" class="aboutImage1">
        <p>
            Mardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always
            involves the use of
            masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are purple, green, and gold.
            In New
            Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals, people from myths, or various Medieval
            costumes[22] as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans).[23] However, many costumes today are simply
            elaborate
            creations of colored feathers and capes. Unlike Halloween costumery, Mardi Gras costumes are not usually
            associated with
            such things as zombies, mummies, bats, blood, and the like, though death may be a theme in some. The Venice
            tradition
            has brought golden masks into the usual round of costumes.

        <h1 class="header">Exposure by women</h1>
        <img src="Images/aboutImage4.jpg" class="aboutImage1">
        <p>
            Women exposing their breasts during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, US, has been documented since 1889, when the
            Times-Democrat decried the " degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the
            streets." The practice was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area.In the crowded
            streets of
            the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to
            form on
            the streets. In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering
            to
            voyeurs helped encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets.
            Social
            scientists studying "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in
            exchange
            for beads or other favors. </p>
